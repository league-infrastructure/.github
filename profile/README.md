# League Infrastructure

The LEAGUE has a few programs that are running in docker to support scheduling, the website and data analysis:

* [Snipserver](https://github.com/league-infrastructure/snipserver), which provides embedible HTML of lists of Pike13 and Meeting events
* [Notifications](https://github.com/league-infrastructure/notifications), which creates notes in Pike13 for Zoom meetings and sends reminder emails to students. 

See the [Infrastructure Wiki](https://github.com/league-infrastructure/league-infrastructure) for other details about the infrastructure.
