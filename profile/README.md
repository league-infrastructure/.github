# League Infrastructure

The LEAGUE has a few programs that are running in docker to support scheduling, the website and data analysis:

* The Snipserver, which provides embedible HTML of lists of Pike13 and Meeting events
* Notifications, which creates notes in Pike13 for Zoom meetings and sends reminder emails to students.
